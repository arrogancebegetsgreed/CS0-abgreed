| Description | ASCII Art and card flip function |
| Due Date | February 9th |
| Status | Complete |
| Location | https://github.com/arrogancebegetsgreed/CS0-abgreed/blob/Assign/Stdio/Stdio.py |
| Self Grade | 100/100 |
| Notes | Met requirements, ran it multiple times to correct spacing and ensure it ran and pull all the cards |

### Assignment #2

| Description | Calculating the area and perimeter of a triangle given number provided through user input. |
| Due Date |  |
| Status | Complete |
| Location | https://github.com/arrogancebegetsgreed/CS0-abgreed/blob/main/Triangle/triangle.py |
| Self Grade | 100/100 |
| Notes | wrote steps as comments, calculated area/perimeter, added description when printing, and ran multiple times to ensure the answers were accurate. Also added in a function to check if the numbers given by the user would actually make up a triangle, and ran it enough to make sure it was actually checking and would print out "This makes a triangle" or "This doesn't make a triangle", but I did not run it 49 times. |

### Assignment #3

| Name | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name | Functions |
| Description | Creating a basic calculator using functions and user input |
| Due Date | 2/28/2024 |
